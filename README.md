A small python script for ploting the 2D Fermi surface from a band structure calculation of Quantum Espresso.

The temprorary script is using python for reading and printing data in a good structure that is suited for gnuplot to plot
a 2D Fermi surface. Some work left to be done to replace gnuplot by matpoltlib functions.
